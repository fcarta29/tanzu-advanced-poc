# SC01-TC04: Onboarding with existing kubernetes clusters

CaaS control plane shall provide automation/tools/API for onboarding existing kubernetes clusters. 

---

## Test Case Summary

This test procedure describes how to automate the onboarding of existing kubernetes clusters to TMC

---

## Prerequisites

* Conforment kubernetes cluster provisioned
* TMC organization and account created
* [TMC CLI downloaded and logged in](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Mission-Control/services/tanzumc-using/GUID-7EEBDAEF-7868-49EC-8069-D278FD100FD9.html)
* kubectl CLI installed

---

## Test Procedure

1. Ensure that the kube context is set to the cluster you would like to attach
   ```execute
   kubectl config current-context
   ```

2. The TMC CLI allows you to attach an existing conforment kubernetes cluster to your TMC organization for management. Use the `-h` flag to 
   show the possible flags for the `tmc cluster attach` command

    ```execute
    tmc cluster attach -h
    ```

3. Minimally you can run the `tmc cluster attach` command with no additional flags. A random cluster name will be generated

    ```execute
    tmc cluster attach
    ```

4. After the kubernetes manifest is generated. Run the following command to create the required TMC resources on the cluster you are attaching

    ```execute
    kubectl apply -f k8s-attach-manifest.yaml
    ```

5. It will take some time for the tmc images to be downloaded to your cluster. After a minute or two you should see your newly attached cluster
in your TMC portal

## Status Pass/Fail

* [  ] Pass
* [  ] Fail
