# SC01-TC04: Supervisor Cluster Control Plane Access and Logging

The vSphere with Tanzu control plane is a set of virtual machines (3) that gets created when workload management on a vCenter Cluster is `Enabled`. This set of control plane virtual machines (3) are responsible for serving the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service and managing Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters that run within a scoped group of resource limits, similar to vCenter resource groups, called a Supervisor Cluster namespace. At certain times or during troubleshooting it may be necessary to view and collect logs from these Supervisor Cluster control plane virtual machines.

---

## Test Case Summary

This test procedure describes how to ssh to Supervisor Cluster control plane nodes and gain access to their logs.

---

## Prerequisites

* Completion of [SC01-TC01](sc01-tc01.md), [SC01-TC02](sc01-tc02.md)
* vCenter Appliance root credentials
* SSH enabled on vCenter Appliance

---

## Test Procedure

1. Using root credentials, initiate an SSH session to the vCenter server.

    ```execute
    ssh root@${VC_APP_IP}
    ```

2. After successful authentication, launch BASH shell by entering the command

    ```execute
    shell
    ```

3. Tail Workload Management log

    ```execute
    tail -f /var/log/vmware/wcp/wcpsvc.log
    ```

4. Next, obtain the token *SC_Mgmt_VIP_IP* and *SC_Root_PWD* password with the command

    ```execute
    /usr/lib/vmware-wcp/decryptK8Pwd.py
    ```

    Then, using the information obtained from the vCenter server, initiate a SSH session to the *SC_Mgmt_VIP_IP*. For example,
    <pre>ssh root@<i><b>SC_Mgmt_VIP_IP</i></b></pre>
    When prompted, enter the ***SC_Root_PWD***

5. Access Management Cluster Deployment Logs

    ```execute
    kubectl logs deployment.apps/capw-controller-manager -n vmware-system-capw manager
    ```

6. Additional Logging Information
    * [Tailing-Workload-Mgmt] (<https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vmware-vsphere-with-tanzu/GUID-F7B30D53-A839-40D9-8D8C-2262AAA5BAD0.html>)
    * [TKG-Logs] (<https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.3/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-13/GUID-troubleshooting-tkg-logs.html>)

## Status Pass/Fail

* [  ] Pass
* [  ] Fail
