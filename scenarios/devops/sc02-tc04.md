## Test Procedure

Because the lab for this POC lacks the ability to be routable from SaaS services like TMC today there are no test procedure steps to follow. In place the following sections point to documentation that describe how to accomplish registering vSphere with Tanzu as a Management Cluster with TMC and lifecycling Kubernetes Workload Clusters.

### Register to Management Cluster

### To uninstall the Tanzu Mission Control agent from the Supervisor Cluster
