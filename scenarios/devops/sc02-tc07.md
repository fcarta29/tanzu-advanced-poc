# SC02-TC07: Creating Consistent and Secure Build Images for Applications

Original Request from Charter: CaaS control plane shall provide curated platform(JVM, NodeJS, Python, Go) images

---

## Test Case Summary

This test case demonstrates a user submitting an "Image" resource and allowing Tanzu Build Service build the image and push to a registry using curated buildpacks that are consistently patched for security and best-practice

---

## Prerequisites

* Completion of [SC01-TC01](sc01-tc01.md), [SC01-TC02](sc01-tc02.md), [SC02-TC07](sc02-tc07.md)
* vSphere Administrator console and user credentials
* Tanzu Build Service installed and running in Shared Services cluster
* Have kpack CLI installed
* Image Repo installed - Harbor installed with Project/Repo
* Git CLI

---

## Test Procedure

1. switch kubecontext to build service cluster
2. kubeapply image manifest - yaml file in directory (spring-petclinic)
3. check image build logs
4. check harbor for image
5. 

1. Change context to the kubernetes cluster where Tanzu Build Service is installed

2. Create a new repository called `microservices-demo` for the images to live in Harbor. For simplicity sake, we will make this a public repo
   
3. Create the registry secret for the service account to publish images to your Harbor registry. (We will use the kpack helper)

    ```sh
    kp secret create harbor-credentials --registry $HARBOR_HOSTNAME --registry-user $HARBOR_USER
    ```

4. Clone the microservices-demo repo

    ```execute
    git clone -b tbs https://github.com/logankimmel/microservices-demo.git && cd microservices-demo
    ```

5. Replace the existing harbor registry with your Harbor registry


    ```sh
    sed -i 's/harbor.vmw.binbytes.io/${HARBOR_HOSTNAME}/g' tbs-build.yaml
    ```

6. Submit build manifest to Tanzu Build Service


    ```execute
    kubectl apply -f tbs-build.yaml
    ```

7. Check status of image builds

    ```execute
    kp image list
    ```

8. Obvserve builds

    ```execute
    kp build list
    ```

9. Inspect logs on a build 

    ```execute
    kp build logs adservice
    ```

10. Once an image has completed the build, check Harbor registry for the newly created image
